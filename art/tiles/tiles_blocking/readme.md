1. Create default plane in Blender.
2. Set camera to isometric.
3. Set resolution to 128x64.
4. Set Camera position: X: 10, Y: -10, Z: ~8.98.
5. Set Camera rotation (in deg) around axis: X: 60, Y: 0, Z: 45.
6. Set Camera ortographic scale to frame the plane (~2.83).
7. Change resolution to 128x128. Use 200% or more for rendering.
8. Set background to transparent.

Plane serves as blocking element for flat area.

Cube serves as blocking element for volume area.
